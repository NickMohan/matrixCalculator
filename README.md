# matrixCalculator

This is a small project I did to both reduce and multiply
matricies.

###How To Use

Start the program then add the numbers you want in your initial
matrix. After you type in your numbers, next choose if you want it
reduced or multiplied by a vector. Make your selection and the desired
output will be shown.

###Improvements For The Future

Add matrix calculating
Add matrix functions
Add composite functions
